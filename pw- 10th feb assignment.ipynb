    "There are many modes for opening a file:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. In ‘r’ mode, the file opens in the read mode. By default, if we don’t specify the mode argument, it will be treated as read or ‘r’ mode. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘r’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\") or open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the ‘w’ mode, the file opens in write mode. It removes existing content, if present, in the file. If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘w’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    " \n",
    "3. In the ‘a’ mode, the file opens in append mode. It adds content to an existing file (or append at the end of the file). If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. It does not remove the existing content from the file. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘a’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the ‘r+’ mode, the file opens in the read & write mode. It does not remove existing content, if present, in the file and does not create a file if not present in the directory. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘r+‘ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r+\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the ‘w+’ mode, open the file in the read & write mode & remove existing content. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. It does not remove existing content & if a file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘w+’ mode:\n",
