    "Logistic regression is primarily a binary classification algorithm that is used to model the relationship between input features and a binary target variable. However, it can also be extended to handle multiclass classification problems through various techniques. Two common approaches for using logistic regression in multiclass classification are the One-vs-Rest (OvR) and the Multinomial (Softmax) methods.\n",

    "One-vs-Rest (OvR) approach:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. For a problem with K classes, K separate logistic regression models are trained.\n",
    "2. In each model, the positive class is one of the K classes, and all other classes are considered as the negative class.\n",

    "4. In the prediction phase, the class with the highest predicted probability is assigned as the final predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach essentially reduces the multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems, with each model distinguishing between one class and the rest. OvR is a simple and widely used technique for multiclass classification using logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial (Softmax) approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial, or Softmax, approach directly extends logistic regression to handle multiclass classification. Instead of treating each class separately, it models the probabilities of all classes simultaneously. The steps involved in the Multinomial approach are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A single logistic regression model is trained using the entire dataset, with the target variable represented using one-hot encoding or categorical labels.\n",
    "2. The model's output is a set of K probabilities, one for each class, representing the likelihood of an instance belonging to each class.\n",
    "3. The probabilities are calculated using the softmax function, which ensures that the predicted probabilities sum to 1.\n",
    "4. During prediction, the class with the highest predicted probability is assigned as the final predicted class.\n",
