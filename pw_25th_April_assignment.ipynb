PCA utilizes Eigen-Decomposition to compute the principal components, which are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data. The eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues represent the directions of maximum variance in the data, and they can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. PCA is commonly used for feature extraction, data visualization, and noise reduction.\n",
