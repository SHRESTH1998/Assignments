    "Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to rescale numeric features to a specific range. It transforms the data so that it falls within a defined minimum and maximum value, typically between 0 and 1. This technique helps to bring all the features to a common scale, eliminating the influence of different magnitudes and ensuring that no feature dominates the others.\n",

In such cases, robust scaling techniques like Z-score normalization or Median-MAD normalization may be more appropriate."

    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction and data compression.
