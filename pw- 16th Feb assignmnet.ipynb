    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\n",

    "Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data."

    "The Main Differences: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type – \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Language –\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases defines and manipulates data based structured query language (SQL). Seeing from a side this language is extremely powerful. SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice especially for great complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability – \n",
    "\n",
    "In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD. But on the other hand \n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Structure – \n",
    "SQL databases are table-based, This makes relational SQL databases a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for legacy systems that were built for a relational structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Property followed – \n",
    "SQL databases follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the NoSQL database follows the Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance). \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Support – \n",
    "Great support is available for all SQL database from their vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for some NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support and only limited outside experts are available for setting up and deploying your large scale NoSQL deployments."
