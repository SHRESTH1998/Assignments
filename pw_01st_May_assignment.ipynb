    "Using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks has certain limitations that should be considered. Here are some of the limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced Classes: Accuracy can be misleading when the classes in the dataset are imbalanced, meaning one class has significantly more samples than the others. In such cases, a classifier that always predicts the majority class can still achieve high accuracy while performing poorly on the minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Misclassification Costs: Accuracy does not take into account the potential costs or consequences of misclassifications. In some scenarios, misclassifying certain classes may have more severe consequences than others. Accuracy treats all misclassifications equally, which may not reflect the real-world impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic Predictions: Accuracy is based on hard predictions, where each instance is assigned to a single class label. However, many classification algorithms provide probabilistic predictions indicating the confidence of the predicted class. Accuracy does not consider the uncertainty in these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, various techniques and alternative evaluation metrics can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix provides a more detailed breakdown of the classification results, showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts for each class. From the confusion matrix, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated, which provide insights into the performance of the classifier on individual classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC Curve and AUC: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different classification thresholds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric summarizes the ROC curve's performance, providing a measure of the classifier's overall discriminative power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision and Recall: Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all predicted positive instances, while recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. These metrics are useful when the focus is on correctly identifying positive instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balanced measure that considers both precision and recall. F1 score is particularly useful when the classes are imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost-Sensitive Evaluation: In scenarios where misclassification costs differ across classes, evaluation metrics can be customized to reflect the associated costs. This involves assigning different weights or penalties to different types of errors."
