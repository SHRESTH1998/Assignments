    "The chi-square test statistic is 3.83, and the p-value is 0.572. Since the p-value (0.572) is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant relationship between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink based on the given survey data.\n",

    "It is important to note that the small sample size in this survey may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, conducting a larger-scale survey with more diverse participants and controlling for other factors could provide more reliable insights into the relationship between age and soft drink preference."
